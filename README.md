## About the project

Grab a copy of the [LICENSE right here!](LICENSE).

The plan is to develop a new open source* server hosting service. For now It's a private project I'll be tinkering on. As a full stack dev I'm responsible for every aspect. I won't be sharing the innovative idea behind the whole project just yet. Anyways the project itself is divided into multiple subprojects...
